                Think current staff training is stuck in the dark age? Us, too. That&apos;s why we&apos;re on a mission to revolutionize the way employees learn and develop their skills.

                In an ideal world, you would have a tutor constantly by your side, guiding you through the learning process of your day to day job. Bur in reality, that&apos;s not currently possible. However, not for much longer.
                <br/>
                We&apos;re increasing the effectiveness of deskless worker training using engaging and interactive AI. Our vision is a world where training days are a thing of the past and eLearning isn&apos;t a fixed set of slides and multiple choice questions. It&apos;s a world where training is performed constantly on the job and one where it&apos;s possible to simulate your work environment before you even set foot on the premises.
